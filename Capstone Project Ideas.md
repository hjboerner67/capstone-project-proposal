Question: How are different game genres received by players? Do certain genres receive better reviews and play-time compared to others?
	The idea of this project is to see how different game genres perform compared to others in terms of sales, review rating, and play-time. Hopefully game developers could utilize this data to see what type of genre they’re most likely to succeed in and that their customers would enjoy. The results of this data could also be expanded upon in a separate study by looking at what aspects of a game within specific genres are well received by the community.

Question: Under what circumstances is it most efficient to attempt three-point shots and does that correlate to winning?
	There’s a growing trend in basketball that seeing a rise in 3-point offense. What the results of this project will hopefully show is if outshooting your opponent/competition can correlate to winning. If so, when is it best for a shooter to take a shot? Do better shooters require less space or passes? Players/teammates can use this data to know when to pass or when to shoot while coaches can draw up plays that will create the best conditions for their player to take a shot.

Question: How does your post-graduate salary correlate to tuition fees? How long will it take to pay off your tuition given your post-graduate salary?
	With rising costs of college tuition, I want to know if it’s worth paying higher tuition for a well-renowned university than a less distinguished school for the same degree. Assuming you start paying it off after you graduate and given your post-graduate salary, how much and for how long will you be paying off your tuition? This data, and its results, are things students and guardians could benefit from before they commit to a university.
